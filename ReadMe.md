###### Q: What is a namespace?
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/namespaces/
Namespace organizes classes inside the .net framework.
###### Q: What are value types?
Struct and Enum are the value types. Structs are numeric types of value types (int, char, byte, float, double, etc).
###### Q: What are reference types?
Reference types are types of variables that reference the actual data as opposed to the data itself (string, interface, class, object).

###### Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
It allows you to get and set properties in shorter code and allowing the properties to be visible outside of the code.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties


###### Q: What is the purpose of using statement?

To call the dispose method in the correct way, additionally making your object read-only not allowing it to be modified.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement

###### Q: What are dynamic type variables?

Variables that might change type or that the type will not be known until run time.

###### Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?

Boolean Loops. Gives back true and false statements.

###### Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/generics/

Allows you to design classes or methods that wont be declared until runtime in order to cut down on runtime or incorrect class / method declaration. It increases code reusability and performance

###### Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?

Represent data in that class in a public manner allowing the class data to be accessed by any code inside the program.


###### Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?

Yes

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments

###### Q: How do you sort an array?

Array.Sort Method.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.array.sort?view=netframework-4.7.2

###### Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?

Allows you to assign a null value to a value type (even though it isn't directly). The only properties that lie inside of nullable types, Value and HasValue. HasValue checks to see if it... has value while value checks what the value is.

###### Q: What is an enumeration?

An enumeration is a data type that contains a set of constants that must be declared inside of the enumerator list.

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_enums.htm

###### Q: What is inheritance?

It is ability that allows classes to "inherit" attributes and behaviors of the existing class in the form of parent & child relationships.

###### Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?

No.


###### Q: What is the purpose of as operator

To convert two reference types or to return null instead of creating an exception.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/as

###### Q: What is an object?

A very dynamic instance that is generally reusable.


###### Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?

Struct is a value type and class is a reference type.


###### Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?

Break closes the loop or switch immediately while continue causes the next iteration to include the next while, for, or do loop to begin.

###### Q: What is this and how is it used?

Qualify members by similar names. It's a pointer.


###### Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?

They're used in methods in order to catch exceptions. You use a try statement then follow it up with a catch exception statement to error control.

###### Q: How is exception handling done?

Try, Catch, Finally, and Throw. It allows you to catch all exceptions and return something that would normally kill your program.

###### Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?

Executes a set of given statements. (Opening and closing a file).

###### Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.

Array:
Set parameters and lengths that cannot be changed during runtime.
Must be accessed by numeric indexes.
Only can accept specified elements.

ArrayList:
Dynamic parameters that changed with added or subtracted elements.
Accessed using the IList interface to interact with elements.
Can accept all elements.

###### Q: What is an object?

An instance that can be stored in a named variable, array, or collection.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/objects

###### Q: Define constructor.

Initializes data members of the class or struct that was called.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-constructors

###### Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?



###### Q: What is an abstract class?

Allows you to create the class on the spot and finish defining the class through a derivative.

###### Q: What is an interface?

Defines functionality that classes or structs can implement which is important due to not being able to inherit multiple classes.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/

###### Q: What is a method?

Main is a method


###### Q: What is a property?

It is a class member that allows us to use the set or get method in which we can read, write, or change the values in the associated fields.

###### Q: What is an access specifier?

Controls the accessability of a type or member when declared.

###### Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?

Public, Private, Protected, Internal, Protected Internal, and Private Protected.



###### Q: What is a collection?

A class specifically for storing data and retrieving said data. You store them in stacks, hash tables, queues, or lists(array list or sorted list).

###### Q: What is a Hash Table?

Something you smoke.
